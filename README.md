1) Best known approximated Pareto fronts:

We have conducetd an experimental study using the 110 Taillard test instances optimizing the Makespan and Total Flowtime. The benchmark is available in http://soa.iti.es/problem-instances.

We have compiled our best known sets. The sets have been created by the union of the approximated Pareto fronts produced by  MEDA/D-MK, several runs, and different parameter settings. You can find our best known sets by downloading the file 'best-known-medadmk-cmax-tft.tar.gz'.

2) Supplentary Document:

The document 'supplementaryResultsInformationScience.pdf' includes additional tables and analysis of the results obtained for Makespan and Total Flowtime such as the average Hypervolume and CPU time.
